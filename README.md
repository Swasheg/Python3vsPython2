This is a script to scrape python programming examples and adding label and  true explaination to it 


Step 1:
first run the scraping.py script to generate python3 file
and run 3to2 to convert the python3 script to python2 format ( there might be some errors in this step which requires you to address by properly formatting the python3 script generated as the website it is scraping for some program examples doesnt have proper python3 format)


step 2:
Run the remove_common_lines.py to remove the common lines in python2 and python3 (be sure to change the file_path according to your file name)


step3:
run trueexplaination_and_csv_file.py to add true explaination and convert the lines to csv file
